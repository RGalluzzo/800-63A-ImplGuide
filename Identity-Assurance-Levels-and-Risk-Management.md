NIST SP 800-63A divides identity proofing requirements into three different assurance levels: Identity Assurance Levels, or IALs, 1, 2 and 3. At each level the document describes unique requirements for the processes, techniques, and approaches that may be taken by agencies and organizations, with increasing levels of stringency. These levels align with the Levels of Assurance, or LOA’s, in Office of Management and Budget’s Memorandum M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies, which outlines overall identity assurance levels based on risk and potential impacts of a system compromise to the agency and users. This alignment and SP 800-63A’s descriptions of assurance levels have been outlined in Table 1.
