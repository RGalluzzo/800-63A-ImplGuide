# Identity Proofing of Foreign Individuals

Identity proofing is required for any applicant requesting the services of a CSP and to the extent that such services are available to foreign nationals, their identity proofing is necessary, as is the capability within a CSP to recognize and proof identities of individuals possessing foreign identification documents. Cross-border initiatives, legal frameworks and multinational industrial efforts exist to meet this challenge and offer a seamless utilization of identity management services that transcends jurisdictions and borders.

The requirements for evidence do not apply only to U.S.-based documents but cover identity documentation from any nation. CSP’s can therefore accept identity evidence from other nations should a risk assessment of their assertion levels find that they meet proofing requirements. If a foreign nation’s identity documents can be accepted as IAL3, then they can be used as a derived credential without additional proofing.

An example to consider is eIDAS, the European Regulation for the electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, which aims to facilitate secure and seamless electronic transactions throughout the EU by providing a regulatory environment that would promote their use. For digital identities falling under eIDAS, Table 10 should be used as a guideline to map identity documents into 800-63A strength levels.

| **eIDAS Level** | **Description** | **SP800-63A Evidence Strength** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low |<ol><li>The person can be assumed to be in possession of evidence recognised by the Member State in which the application for the electronic identity means is being made and representing the claimed identity.<li>The evidence can be assumed to be genuine, or to exist according to an authoritative source and the evidence appears to be valid.<li>It is known by an authoritative source that the claimed identity exists and it may be assumed that the person claiming the identity is one and the same.</ol>| Fair |
| Substantial |Level low, plus one of the alternatives listed in points 1 to 4 has to be met:<br/><ol>1.	The person has been verified to be in possession of evidence recognised by the Member State in which the application for the electronic identity means is being made and representing the claimed identity and the evidence is checked to determine that it is genuine; or, according to an authoritative source, it is known to exist and relates to a real person and steps have been taken to minimise the risk that the person's identity is not the claimed identity, taking into account for instance the risk of lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or expired evidence;
or 
2.	An identity document is presented during a registration process in the Member State where the document was issued and the document appears to relate to the person presenting it and steps have been taken to minimise the risk that the person's identity is not the claimed identity, taking into account for instance the risk of lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or expired documents;
or 
3.	Where procedures used previously by a public or private entity in the same Member State for a purpose other than the issuance of electronic identification means provide for an equivalent assurance to those set out in section 2.1.2 for the assurance level substantial, then the entity responsible for registration need not to repeat those earlier procedures, provided that such equivalent assurance is confirmed by a conformity assessment body referred to in Article 2(13) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council or by an equivalent body; 
or 
4.	Where electronic identification means are issued on the basis of a valid notified electronic identification means having the assurance level substantial or high, and taking into account the risks of a change in the person identification data, it is not required to repeat the identity proofing and verification processes. Where the electronic identification means serving as the basis has not been notified, the assurance level substantial or high must be confirmed by a conformity assessment body referred to in Article 2(13) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or by an equivalent body.
