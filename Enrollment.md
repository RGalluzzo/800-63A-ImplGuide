# Enrollment

The first step to proof an individual is to collect the core attributes necessary to establish a unique representation of the individual’s identity for use during the proofing process. The core attributes, regardless of IAL, should be collected in accordance with the requirements identified in SP800-63A.

While the information collected should be the minimum required by the CSP for its use in the proofing process, it is permissible for the CSP to collect additional information in the process of identity proofing an applicant, if the applicant explicitly consents to the CSP collecting and/or storing the attributes as outlined by the CSP. When attributes are not present within the collected evidence but require the CSP to query other data sources, the applicant’s explicit consent should again be sought.

CSP’s should also note that not all biographical data collected during the enrollment phase is used for enrollment. Some biographical attributes may in fact be evidence collected for the resolution phase that follows. The collection of these core attributes is intended to help the CSP resolve applicants to a single unique entity and to enable the appropriate level of verification and validation to support system risk. It is ultimately up to the CSP or agency to determine which biographic information to collect about an applicant. Some commonly used core attributes are listed in Table 3.

## Collection Techniques

During enrollment, CSP’s may use multiple techniques for collecting attributes in different media. These pertain to digital or other methods of collection that result in the transmission of information from the applicant to the CSP.  As noted earlier, while the processes laid out in this guide suggest multiple phases of collection, it is possible that agencies or CSPs could choose to collect core attributes, additionally required attributes, and evidence during the same event. Multiple techniques may also be combined based on agency requirements, user needs, and the overall approved proofing process flow.

### Digital

The initial information may be captured via an online form or web application directly from the applicant that is being proofed. This internet accessible form provides the applicant with the flexibility and convenience to begin the enrollment process as their schedule allows.

In other cases, the CSP may allow the applicant to provide some documents via remote means, such as submitting an image of an identification document like a passport or a driver’s license. This workflow requires the utilization of some form of digital capture, such as a camera or a document scanner with a resolution higher than an acceptable threshold. Systems with optical character recognition capabilities that allow fields in a document to be pre-populated upon scanning should also allow the applicant to review and validate the information as correct.
